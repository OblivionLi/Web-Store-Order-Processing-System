*   **Description:** (Includes both Factory Method and Abstract Factory) "The Factory pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying their exact class. This is particularly useful when you have different types of objects that need to be created based on certain conditions or configurations. In web development, you might use a Factory to create different types of database connections (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or different types of API clients based on the environment."
