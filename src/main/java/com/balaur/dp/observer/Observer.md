*   **Description:** "The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes, its dependents are notified. In web development, this is very important for real-time updates, implementing event-driven systems, and in front-end frameworks for handling data changes and UI updates (e.g., data binding in Angular, React, Vue.js)."
