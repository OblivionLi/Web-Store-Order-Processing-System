**1. Dependency Injection**

*   **Description:** "Dependency Injection is a technique where an object receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. In web development, it's heavily used in frameworks (like Angular, Spring) to manage dependencies between components, services, and modules. This makes your code more loosely coupled, testable, and maintainable."

**2. Model-View-Controller (MVC) / Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**

*   **Description:** While considered an architectural pattern rather than a strict design pattern, MVC and its close relative, MVVM, are fundamental to modern web frameworks.
    *   **MVC:**  "MVC separates the application into three interconnected parts: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and updates the Model and View). It makes web applications more organized, maintainable, and testable."
    *   **MVVM:** "MVVM is a variation of MVC where the ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model, exposing data and commands that the View can bind to. It's common in front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, and improves the separation of concerns even further."
